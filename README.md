# kolitech-project-web-development
This is my project in Website development course in BS in Computer Engineering in third year, first semester school yr 2020-2021. I used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and mySQL to create this project. 

Unfortunately, I had 10 course subjects in first semester so the website is not neat at the index.php and dashboard.php. So I barely given this an attention but I tried with a busy schedule. I also had no time cleaning the website because after five days of first semester, second semester came. How I wish to recreate something like this because I believe it is not neat and I think I can build much better. 

Anyway, while creating this project made me love to code even more. I am looking forware in both front-end and back-end development. Both are difficult in their own way.
